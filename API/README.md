# testMinions
Python Flask API project

**GIT remote repository URL:**

		https://github.com/guru1212/testMinions.git

**Objective:** This Python Flask REST API project acts as a master which control a bunch of servers as minions.

This project exposes the below URL to the client to receive the necessary data in JSON format to login to minions and perform some operations.

		http://<hostname:5000>/master/api/run/

**Data required to perform the operations:**

1) host name, username and password of the server to login.

2) operations to be performed on that server.

Sample JSON request as below.


		{

		"host":"vm-gsethura-002",

		"username" : "root",

		"password":"Cisco123",

		"todo" : [

		{"operation1":"mkdir"},

		{"operation2":"ls"}

		]

		}

**How to Dockerize Python Flask project:**

Once the files from GIT hub is pulled to local, launch Docker Quickstart Terminal and change directory to cloned local project directory - testMinions/API/ where there is a docker file and execute the below commands to build docker image and to run the application.

**Build docker image:** 

		docker build -t flask-python .

**To list the docker image created:** 

		docker images

**To run the app inside the container:** 

		docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name flask-container flask-python

The above dockerize steps will install Python2.7 and the required modules/libraries and will start the python API application.

**To check the API:**
1) Open RestClient in mozilla Firefox. If this add-on is not installed then can be added to mozilla - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/restclient/

**Get Method:**

2) In restclient, select method as **GET** and URL - **http://\<hostname\>:5000/**

  Note: hostname is the default VM of the docker whcih gets configured at the time of launching Docker Quickstart Terminal. This IP should be displayed once docker is launched successfully. 

3) Add authentication: - Authentication->Basic Authentication: **Username** -> admin **Passworrd** -> pass123

4) Add headers: - Headers->Custom Headers-> **Name** : Content-Type **Value**: application/json

Click Send.

This get method will just display **Hello World** in restclients response body.

**Post Method:**

5) In restclient, select method as **POST** and URL - **http://\<hostname\>:5000//master/api/run/**

6) Add the above mentioned sample json payload in the body and click send. Following is the Cisco VM that was created for this task. Same can be used for the test as well but the running application should be dockerized in cisco network.

  	"host":"vm-gsethura-002",
	"username" : "root",
	"password":"Cisco123",

Or a differnt hosts can also be used if the app is dockerized outside of Cisco network, but above mentioned data ie. hostname, username, password is required to be provided for the APP to login to that host and to perform the mentioned operations in the payload.
